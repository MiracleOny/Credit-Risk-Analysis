# Overview 
The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the performance of three sampling algorithims in predicting credit risk. 

### Part 1
I will oversample the data using RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms and undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Then, I will use a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Next, I will compare two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk.

### Part 2

### Data
Credit card dataset was taken from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company.

## Results
Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

## Summary
Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
